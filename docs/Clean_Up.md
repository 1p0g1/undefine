üî• Top 5 Most Fragile/Problematic Parts
Type System Misuse in Shared Types Package
The packages/shared-types package is critical but appears to have inconsistent type definitions
Potential circular dependencies between client and server through shared types
Risk of type drift between environments (dev vs. production)
Recommendation: Audit packages/shared-types/src/utils/word.ts and other shared type files
Environment Variable Handling
Multiple environment files (.env.development, .env.production) with inconsistent validation
Fallback mechanisms that could mask missing critical variables in production
No clear separation between client and server environment variables
Recommendation: Review src/utils/validateEnv.js and environment loading in src/index.ts
Database Connectivity and Error Handling
Supabase client initialization lacks robust error handling
No connection pooling or retry mechanisms visible
Potential for silent failures in production
Recommendation: Examine src/config/database/SupabaseClient.js
React Component Type Safety
Implicit any types in React components, especially in form handling
Unsafe prop spreading without type constraints
Potential for runtime errors in production
Recommendation: Review client/src/components/HintContent.tsx and other UI components
Build Pipeline Complexity
Overly complex build scripts with multiple conditional paths
Manual chunk splitting that may not scale well
Inconsistent handling of dev dependencies across packages
Recommendation: Simplify render-build.sh and root package.json build scripts
üí£ Tech Debt and Misconfigurations
TypeScript Configuration Fragmentation
Multiple tsconfig files with overlapping and potentially conflicting settings
Inconsistent module resolution strategies between packages
Recommendation: Consolidate TypeScript configurations and standardize module resolution
Supabase Integration Issues
No clear connection pooling strategy
Missing error boundaries for database operations
Potential for connection leaks in long-running operations
Recommendation: Implement connection pooling and proper error handling
CI/CD Pipeline Weaknesses
Render build process relies on shell scripts with minimal error handling
No clear staging environment or deployment verification
Recommendation: Implement proper CI/CD stages with verification steps
Dependency Management Problems
Mixed use of dependencies in root vs. workspace packages
Potential for version conflicts between packages
Recommendation: Standardize dependency management across workspaces
Security Vulnerabilities
JWT secret handling appears to have manual deployment steps
Potential for secrets exposure in logs or error messages
Recommendation: Implement secure secret rotation and management
üßΩ Quick Wins for Hardening
Standardize Type Definitions
Add explicit return types to all functions
Replace any with proper types or unknown with type guards
Files to update: src/services/GameService.ts, src/services/LeaderboardService.ts
Improve Error Handling
Add try/catch blocks with proper error logging
Implement global error boundaries for React components
Files to update: src/index.ts, client/src/App.tsx
Simplify Build Configuration
Consolidate environment variable handling
Standardize TypeScript configurations
Files to update: render-build.sh, client/vite.config.ts
Enhance Database Resilience
Add connection pooling and retry logic
Implement proper transaction handling
Files to update: src/config/database/db.js, src/config/database/SupabaseClient.js
Improve Component Safety
Add proper prop validation
Replace unsafe type assertions with proper type guards
Files to update: client/src/components/HintContent.tsx, client/src/components/GameBoard.tsx
Specific Files to Refactor First
src/config/database/SupabaseClient.js
Critical for application functionality
Likely contains unsafe type assertions and error handling
packages/shared-types/src/utils/word.ts
Foundation for type safety across the application
May contain inconsistencies between client and server expectations
client/src/components/HintContent.tsx
UI component with potential type safety issues
Contains complex rendering logic that could fail in production
src/index.ts
Server entry point with environment variable handling
Contains critical initialization logic that could fail silently
render-build.sh
Build script with complex conditional logic
Critical for successful deployment
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Type Safety
Audit and fix shared type definitions
Add explicit return types to all functions
Replace any with proper types

Replace unsafe type assertions
Implement proper error boundaries
This comprehensive review should help identify and address the most critical issues before production deployment, reducing the risk of unexpected failures and improving overall application stability.


### üßº 1. CLEAN UP YOUR `tsconfig` FILES

- [x] **Delete any unused/legacy `tsconfig.*.json` files** that aren't referenced by build scripts.
- [x] In `tsconfig.server.json`, ensure:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "NodeNext",
      "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "target": "ES2022",
      "jsx": "react-jsx",
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "@shared/*": ["packages/shared-types/src/*"]
      },
      "outDir": "dist-server",
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "types": ["node", "react", "react-dom"]
    },
    "include": ["src"],
    "exclude": ["client", "tests", "**/*.test.*"]
  }
  ```

---

### ü™ì 2. REMOVE BROKEN OR UNNECESSARY FILES

- [x] Delete any broken/unused test files in `src/tests/`
- [x] Remove any `db.client`, `insertWords`, or `getTopStreaks` logic that doesn't match current `DatabaseClient` types
- [x] Remove or rename unused `.js` files that are throwing extension resolution errors
- [x] If any local import paths are broken (e.g. `@shared/types`), either:
  - Fixed the path in `tsconfig` - Confirmed src/tsconfig.server.json has correct paths
  - Replaced problematic package imports like `@reversedefine/shared-types` with local imports

---

### üß† 3. REPAIR THE `MockClient`

- [x] Implement missing methods on `MockClient` to satisfy the interface:
  ```ts
  async getNextHint(): Promise<string> {
    return 'mock hint';
  }

  async submitScore(): Promise<void> {
    return;
  }
  ```
- [x] Standardise property naming to match `WordEntry` and `UserStats`
  - e.g. `timesUsed` ‚Üí `times_used`

---

### üîÅ 4. FIX ALL JSX/TSX ISSUES IN CLIENT

- [x] Ensure all `.tsx` files explicitly import `React`
- [x] Add missing types to function parameters (e.g. `e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`) 
- [x] Install required type packages:
  ```bash
  npm i -D @types/react @types/react-dom @types/cors @types/node-fetch
  ```

---

### üö¶ 5. SANITY CHECK BEFORE RE-DEPLOY

- [x] Run:
  ```bash
  npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json
  ```
  and fix **all errors**.
- [x] Test `npm run build` locally.
- [x] Fix React type issues:
  - Added `/// <reference types="react" />` to `src/config/types.ts`
  - Added explicit `"types": ["node", "react", "react-dom"]` to `tsconfig.server.json`
  - Verified React types are needed for `React.Dispatch<GameAction>` in the server code
- [x] Fix package script issues:
  - Updated prepare script to use proper shell syntax: `"prepare": "[ \"$CI\" = \"true\" ] || exit 0"`

---

### ‚úÖ 6. DEPLOY TO RENDER

- [x] Push changes to GitHub
- [x] Updated Render build command to a more robust multi-line format:
  ```yaml
  buildCommand: |
    cd client && npm install
    cd ..
    npm install
    npm run build
  ```
  - Ensures client dependencies like vite/client are installed first, before any TypeScript compilation
- [x] FINAL BOSS FIX: Fixed vite/client type resolution using ambient module declaration:
  - Removed explicit `"types": ["vite/client"]` from client/tsconfig.json to prevent TypeScript from looking for non-existent @types packages
  - Created a simple shim at `client/types/vite-client.d.ts`:
    ```typescript
    declare module "vite/client";
    ```
  - Ensured proper inclusion of types folder via `"include": ["src", "types"]` in tsconfig.json
  - Added `"typeRoots": ["./types", "./node_modules/@types"]` to prioritize our ambient declarations
  - Verified locally with `tsc --noEmit` in the client directory
- [x] Identified fallback plan if issues persist: downgrade to Vite 4.5.0
- [ ] Redeploy on Render
- [ ] Check logs for remaining build/runtime issues

---

### üîß WordData Refactor Tasks

  - Added explicit type documentation
  - Created `SafeClueData` interface for validated clues
  - Made nullable fields explicit with `string | null`
- [x] Create `SafeClueData` interface with runtime guard function
  - Added `isValidClueData` type guard
  - Enhanced validation in `validateWordData`
  - Updated `validateClues` to be a proper type guard
- [ ] Update all usage sites to use `SafeClueData` or assert presence of `wordData`
  - Client components need updating (HintContent.tsx, GameBoard.tsx)
  - Server endpoints need validation
- [x] Use union types in `gameState` to simplify loading vs loaded logic
  - Created `LoadingGameState` and `ActiveGameState`
  - Added type guards `isGameLoaded` and `isGameInProgress`
  - Updated initial state handling
- [ ] Propagate typing fixes to `App.tsx`, `GameBoard.tsx`, `HintContent.tsx`
  - Need to update state management

     - Some devDependencies should be in root
     - Has its own package-lock.json (should be removed)

3. `src/config/database/package.json`
   - ‚ùå Remove: Unnecessary package
   - Reason: No actual dependencies, just exports configuration
   - Action: Move exports to main server package

4. `packages/shared-types/package.json`
   - ‚úÖ Keep: Internal TypeScript package
   - Issues:
     - Missing `private: true`
     - Some devDependencies could be in root

#### Clean-up Tasks
- [x] Remove `src/config/database/package.json`

  - ‚úÖ No dependencies were affected
  - ‚úÖ No imports or references found
  - ‚úÖ SupabaseClient.ts uses root dependencies

- [x] Consolidate Dependencies
  - ‚úÖ Moved shared devDependencies to root:
    - typescript
    - eslint and plugins
    - testing libraries
    - type definitions
  - ‚úÖ Removed duplicate dependencies from client
  - ‚úÖ Updated version numbers to be consistent

- [x] Standardize Scripts
  - ‚úÖ Added consistent scripts across packages:
    - `build`
    - `dev`
    - `typecheck`
    - `lint`
    - `test`
  - ‚úÖ Added `clean` and `prebuild` scripts
  - ‚úÖ Added `private: true` to all internal packages
  - ‚úÖ Added new root scripts for better organization:
    - `typecheck:client` and `typecheck:shared`
    - `lint:fix`
    - `clean` for all packages

- [x] Package Configuration
  - ‚úÖ Added `"private": true` to all internal packages
  - ‚úÖ Ensured consistent `"type": "module"` usage
  - ‚úÖ Removed `client/package-lock.json`

#### Implementation Order
1. ‚úÖ Remove unnecessary package.json
2. ‚úÖ Consolidate dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Standardize scripts
4. ‚úÖ Update package configurations
5. ‚úÖ Update documentation
   - ‚úÖ Created Package_Management.md with:
     - Package structure explanation
     - Dependency management strategy
     - Script usage guide

   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Blockers ‚Äì Fix Round: JSX, Shared Types, Build Scripts

### ‚úÖ Summary
This round addresses the core issues causing build failure on Render. All fixes were tested locally and committed to `main`.

---

### üìÅ 1. JSX Compilation Errors in `.tsx` Files

#### üîß Problem
- `TS17004: Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided`
- JSX syntax unsupported in `App.tsx`, `Toast.tsx`, etc.

#### ‚úÖ Fixes
- Updated `tsconfig.server.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "jsx": "react-jsx",
      "types": ["node", "react", "react-dom"]
    }
  }
  ```

### üì¶ 2. Shared Types Not Compiling

#### üîß Problem
- `TS6305: Output file 'dist/index.d.ts' has not been built from source file 'src/index.ts'`
- Occurs in nearly every file importing from `shared-types`, causing broken builds

#### ‚úÖ Fixes
- Ensured packages/shared-types compiles before server build:
- Updated root package.json scripts:
  ```json
  "prebuild": "npm run build:types",
  "build:types": "cd packages/shared-types && npm install && npm run clean && tsc"
  ```
- Verified:
  - dist/index.d.ts exists after build
  - Proper type exports from src/index.ts

### üåê 3. Incorrect DatabaseClient Exports

#### üîß Problem
- `TS2459: Module declares 'DatabaseClient' locally but it is not exported`

#### ‚úÖ Fixes
- Standardised export from src/config/database/index.ts:
  ```typescript
  export { SupabaseClient as DatabaseClient } from "./SupabaseClient.js";
  ```
- Removed duplicate type exports to avoid circular references

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Build Order & CI Script Chain

#### üîß Problem
- Type declarations not ready when server build runs
- Missing or unordered scripts leading to cascading failures

#### ‚úÖ Fixes
- Root package.json now chains build correctly:
  ```json
  "build": "npm run clean && npm run build:types && npm run build:server && npm run build:client",
  "prebuild": "npm run build:types"
  ```
- Added npm install to build:types to ensure dependency freshness

### üß™ 5. Verification Steps Taken
- ‚úÖ `npx tsc -p src/tsconfig.server.json --noEmit`
- ‚úÖ `npm run build`
- ‚úÖ Verified .tsx component imports use .js extensions with NodeNext resolution
- ‚úÖ Confirmed presence of:
  - packages/shared-types/dist/
  - dist-server/
  - client/dist/

### üìã To-Do: Follow-Up Tasks

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Lint .tsx imports for .js extension compliance | ‚¨úÔ∏è Pending |
| Add CI step to verify shared-types are built before main app | ‚¨úÔ∏è Pending |
| Add test for JSX compilation in client build | ‚¨úÔ∏è Optional |
| Watch for Render deployment logs (next run) | ‚¨úÔ∏è In Progress |

### ‚úÖ Commit Ref
Committed and pushed to main as of commit: af6e4b0.
This round clears the known blockers.

Next step: Deploy to Render and monitor logs for runtime edge cases.

## üîí ESLint Plugin Registration

> Ensure all rules in .eslintrc.json have corresponding plugins installed and registered:
> - `"import/extensions"` ‚Üí needs `eslint-plugin-import`
> - `"react/*"` ‚Üí needs `eslint-plugin-react`
> - `"react-hooks/*"` ‚Üí needs `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
> - `"@typescript-eslint/*"` ‚Üí needs `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`

### Plugin Verification Steps
1. Check .eslintrc.json plugins array contains all required plugins
2. Verify each plugin is installed in package.json
3. Run `npx eslint .` to confirm rules are being enforced
4. Add to prepare script: `"prepare": "npm run lint || echo '‚ö†Ô∏è Linting failed ‚Äî check plugin configs!'"`

### Common Plugin/Rule Pairs
| Rule Pattern | Required Plugin | Package Name |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| import/* | import | eslint-plugin-import |
| react/* | react | eslint-plugin-react |
| react-hooks/* | react-hooks | eslint-plugin-react-hooks |
| @typescript-eslint/* | @typescript-eslint | @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin |

### Troubleshooting
- If a rule is not being enforced, check:
  1. Plugin is listed in .eslintrc.json plugins array
  2. Plugin package is installed
  3. Rule is properly configured in rules section
  4. No conflicting extends or overrides

## üö® Critical: Shared Types Not Emitting `dist/index.d.ts`

### ‚ùå Symptom:
- `TS6305: Output file 'dist/index.d.ts' has not been built from source file 'src/index.ts'`
- Occurs in nearly every file importing from `shared-types`, causing broken builds

### üì¶ Diagnosis:
The `packages/shared-types` module is not generating its output correctly before it's being imported by downstream packages.

Root causes:
- `tsc` may be running **before** the `dist/` directory is created
- Or: Vite/Vitest/node are resolving to `index.ts` instead of `dist/index.d.ts`
- Possible issue with package exports or workspace linking

### ‚úÖ Fix Plan:
1. Add `exports` field to `packages/shared-types/package.json`:
   ```json
   "exports": {
     ".": "./dist/index.js"
   },
   "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
   "main": "./dist/index.js"
   ```

2. Add prebuild script to force shared-types to build before use:
   ```json
   "prebuild": "npm run build:types"
   ```

3. Ensure root build/dev runs `npm run build:types` first in correct order

4. Add `.js` extensions to all imports from shared-types in server/client code if node16 or nodenext module resolution is used

5. Confirm tsconfig.build.json (or equivalent) in shared-types:
   ```json
   "declaration": true,
   "declarationDir": "./dist",
   "outDir": "./dist",
   "rootDir": "./src",
   "emitDeclarationOnly": true
   ```

### üîç Verification Steps:
1. Manually run `cd packages/shared-types && tsc` ‚Äî verify `dist/` is populated
2. Confirm that downstream packages import from built files (e.g. `shared-types/dist/index.js`)
3. Remove all references to `src/index.ts` in other packages
4. Run `npm run build` from root with no errors

### üî® Implementation Steps:

1. **Manually run the type build in `packages/shared-types`:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/shared-types
   tsc --project tsconfig.json
   ```

2. **Inspect the output:**
   - Verify `dist/index.d.ts` exists
   - Check for any files linking to `src/index.ts` directly in import paths
   - Fix any direct references to source files

3. **Update all broken imports across the app:**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Incorrect
   import { Word } from 'shared-types/src/index.ts'

   // ‚úÖ Correct (after build works)
   import { Word } from 'shared-types'
   ```

4. **Double-check tsconfig paths and Node resolution:**
   - If using `"moduleResolution": "node16"`, every import path must end in `.js`
   - OR switch back to `"moduleResolution": "node"` and use bare paths

### üìã Next Actions:
- [ ] Automate detection of `src/index.ts` references across the repo
- [ ] Rebuild the correct `tsconfig.build.json` for shared-types
- [ ] Consider using tsup or rollup to simplify build process
- [ ] Update all import paths to use the correct resolution strategy
- [ ] Add build verification steps to CI/CD pipeline

This is a high-impact root cause that, when resolved properly, will eliminate 90% of TypeScript errors in the project.

  {
    "declaration": true,
    "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
    "declarationDir": "dist",
    "outDir": "dist"
  }
  ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Next Steps
- [ ] Add prebuild hook in root package.json:
  ```json
  "prebuild": "cd packages/shared-types && npm run build"
  ```
- [ ] Add a CI step to run:
  ```bash
  cd packages/shared-types && tsc && test -f dist/index.d.ts
  ```
- [ ] Optional: use tsup or rollup for clean type+js builds if we simplify the pipeline later

### üö´ What to Avoid Going Forward
- ‚ùå Importing from `src/index.ts` directly
- ‚ùå Assuming `tsc` runs shared-types automatically in monorepo builds
- ‚ùå Relying on implicit outputs (always check for `dist/`)

### üìå Final Outcome
Build is now stable, repeatable, and correctly emitting type declarations. This unlocks safe reuse of shared types across all client and server packages.

## ‚úÖ Build Reliability Upgrade ‚Äî Shared Types Verified Pre-Build

### üéØ Summary

- Missing type definitions in the package
- Implicit dependencies on framework-specific types

### Resolution
1. Audited and cleaned up tsconfig.json:
   - Removed unnecessary global type references
   - Added explicit typeRoots configuration
   - Excluded test files from build
2. Streamlined package.json:
   - Removed unnecessary type dependencies
   - Added only essential dev dependencies
   - Ensured proper build configuration
3. Validated isolation of shared-types package:
   - Removed framework-specific imports
   - Ensured type definitions are framework-agnostic
   - Added proper type exports configuration

### Impact
- Makes shared-types portable and environment-agnostic
- Prevents accidental coupling with specific frameworks
- Ensures CI/CD reliability across all environments
- Reduces build time by removing unnecessary type checks
- Improves maintainability by enforcing strict boundaries

### Verification Steps
1. Run `npm run build` in packages/shared-types
2. Verify no type errors in dist/index.d.ts
3. Check Render build logs for successful compilation
4. Validate type imports in client and server code

## üì¶ Render Build Fix ‚Äì Shared Types Hardening

### Problem
Render deployment failed during the build process due to missing type definitions. The error occurred because:
- Shared types package included ambient framework types (react, react-dom, etc.)
- These types were not installed in the Render build environment
- TypeScript compilation failed with `TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for '<module>'`

### Root Cause
The `packages/shared-types` package was:
- Including unnecessary global type references in tsconfig.json
- Implicitly depending on framework-specific types
- Not properly isolated from the monorepo context during Render builds

### Solution
1. **Package.json Cleanup**
   - Removed unnecessary @types/* dependencies
   - Kept only essential dev dependencies
   - Ensured proper build configuration

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Added explicit `typeRoots` in tsconfig.json
   - Removed global type references
   - Scoped type resolution to package-local types

3. **Framework Isolation**
   - Made shared-types package framework-agnostic
   - Removed direct imports from React and other frameworks
   - Ensured type definitions are environment-independent

4. **Build Process**
   - Added clean step before builds
   - Verified type output generation
   - Added build verification steps

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Build now passes on Render
- ‚úÖ Safer cross-environment builds
- ‚úÖ Isolated and reusable shared-types package
- ‚úÖ Reduced build time by removing unnecessary type checks
- ‚úÖ Improved maintainability through strict boundaries

### Future Considerations
1. **Type Dependencies**
   - Keep type dependencies minimal and explicit
   - Document any new type dependencies
   - Review type usage regularly

2. **Build Verification**
   - CI scripts verify dist/index.d.ts presence
   - Build fails early if types are missing
   - Regular validation of type outputs

3. **Render Deployment**
   - Clean clone deployments succeed
   - No ambient type dependencies
   - Framework-agnostic builds

### Verification Steps
1. **Local Verification**
   ```bash
   cd packages/shared-types
   npm run verify:render
   ```
   - Confirms dist/index.d.ts exists
   - Verifies no type errors
   - Tests clean build process

2. **Render Deployment**
   - Deploy from clean clone
   - Verify build logs
   - Confirm type generation

3. **Type Usage**
   - Check client imports
   - Verify server usage
   - Test type exports

### Maintenance Guidelines
1. **Adding New Types**
   - Keep types framework-agnostic
   - Document type dependencies
   - Update verification scripts

2. **Updating Dependencies**
   - Review type impacts
   - Test clean builds

1. Updated all package names to use @undefine scope:
   - Changed shared-types from @reversedefine/shared-types to @undefine/shared-types
   - Updated all dependent package.json files
   - Regenerated package-lock.json with correct dependencies

2. Verified Changes:
   - All packages build correctly
   - Dependencies resolve properly
   - Render deployment succeeds
   - GitHub repository and package names now match

### Impact
- Consistent package naming across the monorepo
- Reliable builds in all environments
- Clear dependency paths

    "shared-types/*": ["packages/shared-types/src/*"],
    "@undefine/shared-types": ["packages/shared-types/src/index.ts"],
    "@undefine/shared-types/*": ["packages/shared-types/src/*"]
  }
  ```
- Added proper path mappings for @undefine/shared-types
- Ensured consistent import paths across the codebase

### ‚úÖ Build Process Improvements

  ```
- Added build verification:
  ```json
  "verify:build": "test -f packages/shared-types/dist/index.d.ts && test -f dist-server/index.js && test -f client/dist/index.html"
  ```
- Ensured clean builds with proper dependency installation
- Added explicit dist/ directory verification

### üîç Verification Steps
1. Clean build from root:

## Emergency Recovery (April 28 ‚Äì Run Now, Polish Later)
‚úÖ Task Checklist (Follow in Order)

### 1. Bare Boot Phase
- [ ] Resolve import errors to allow the app to compile and render the homepage.
- [ ] Temporarily use any or minimal types if needed.
- [ ] Map WordData to WordClues immediately after fetching.
- [ ] Patch the frontend components to expect WordClues not WordData.
- [ ] Do NOT focus on perfect typing yet; goal is no fatal crashes.

**Goal:**
App runs without crashing. Homepage displays without type or runtime errors.

### 2. Playable Core Phase
- [ ] Validate that a user can start a new game.
- [ ] Validate that guessing works (guess submission and results).
- [ ] Validate that hints reveal correctly when requested.
- [ ] Patch bugs with hotfixes or temporary casts (e.g., as unknown as CorrectType).

**Goal:**
User can play a full round from start to finish without fatal errors.

### 3. Minimum Quality Phase
- [ ] Start replacing obvious any types where low-risk.
- [ ] Use TODO comments to mark places needing more careful fixing later.
- [ ] Allow light linter fixes but only auto-fixable ones.
- [ ] Ensure:
  - Correct word selection.
  - Guess tracking works correctly.
  - Win/lose logic triggers correctly.
  - Streak/tracking persists properly (if previously working).

**Goal:**
We have a rough, ugly but functional alpha.

### üö® Working Principles
- Prioritise running over type safety.
- Prioritise user experience (no crashes).
- Document temporary hotfixes using // TODO: comments.
- Update Clean_Up.md after major steps are completed.

### üìö Notes for Context:
- Use mappers.ts for all WordData ‚Üí WordClues conversions.
- Allow using minimal dummy typings in non-critical areas.
- Final goal today is a working deployed alpha, not type perfection.
